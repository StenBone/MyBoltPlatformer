* Notice on the player movement there is no logic for multiplying the movement by delta time. The reason for this is that the physics for the player is set to interpolate. This means the physics updates and screen refresh are happening at simliar times.
* Shift + Enter to expand a window
* Not all flow nodes require flow, the system is smart enough to work backwards.
* Continuous collision detection tests the enitire movement, not just between frames.
* A ray cast sends a ray out into world space, a box cast sends a box collider into world space
* When using layers, you must be consitent about assigning layers where they fit. For instance assigning a layer Floor in this game is directly tied to when the player can jump. Slow is Smooth. Smooth is Fast. TODO: I'm thinking about changing this so that the as long as the boxcast doesn't collide with Player layer, they can jump.
* Sorting Layers and Layers are different
* For sorting layers, the highest number is drawn on top of everything else
* Super Units are like funcitons for collecting a group of nodes to organize the flow graph
* Groups can be formed by holding down Ctrl, this is a helpful way document code
* Object variables can be used for cacheing variables
* Pay attention to your windows when working with animators and animations
* Must click on the object that has the animator in the Scene Hierarchy to start working on the animator
* Cinemachine can be previewed while playing the game in the Game view and modified while the game is running. 
* The sorting order for text mesh pro is based on the heirarchy order
* Add a container to safely turn on and off ui elements
* With events, work backwards. Wire up where you need the event and then work backwards to where the event needs to trigger.
* Events can be used almost as if they are function calls. Great way for Game Objects to communicate with each other.
* Getting the names for events and event triggers to match up is crucial
* Whenever iterating always test step by step with debug output statements. Feel free to delete these statements when done to keep code uncluttered.
* You can add new assemblies through Unit Options Wizard. This is helpful for adding types like TextMeshPro.
* Important Lesson: A node that has a series of computations behind it needs to only by its output to another node once. Visual Scripting works backwards. So every node that tries to read from the output will perform the computations again.
